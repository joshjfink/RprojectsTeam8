1.min_span_tree.R
According to the Prim Algorithm, we use get_adj_mat2 function to get the adjacent matrix (use Inf rather than 0 as default value of the matrix);  then we use add_vertex function to add vertex for minimum span tree. In the main function, U is used to store the vertexs which has been included in the function; V is the vertexs which is not included in the function. adjvex represents the minimal-weight edges between each vertex to U; lowcost stores the weight of these edges. Each time a vertex will be included into U, then adjvex and lowcost will be updated.

2.shortest_path.R
We use the idea of recursive. The function path_len is used to calculate the length of a path; short_path is the main recursive function.
