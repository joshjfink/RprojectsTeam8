### Visualization
***
This basic visualization gives one some ideas of what the macro-level patterns of La Quinta and Denny's locations look like. It does appear there is some correlation--although admittedly some of this is simply due to overall urbanization and the clustering of businesses in major cities.

```{r1}
load(file="lq/hotel data.Rdata")
load(file="dennys/dennys_data.Rdata")

source("check_packages.R")
check_packages(c("maps", "mapdata","fields"))

# get the longitude and latitude information
lq_lat = as.numeric(hotel_data[,5])
lq_lon = as.numeric(hotel_data[,6])
de_lat = as.numeric(as.character(dennys$latitude))
de_lon = as.numeric(as.character(dennys$longitude))


map("state", interior = FALSE)
map("state", boundary = FALSE, col="gray", add = TRUE)
points(lq_lon,lq_lat, col = "blue", pch = 1.2)
points(de_lon,de_lat, col = "red", pch = 1.2)
title(main = "Map of US La Quinta and Denny's Locations")
```

### Distance Analysis
***
Here  we perform basic calculations to summarize information on the distance between La Quinta and Denny's locations. Using 150 meters as a maximum threshold deinfing close proximity, we find 48 La Quinta locations next to Denny's, which many would consider quite high.

```{r2, }
# a distance matrix
distance = rdist.earth(cbind(de_lon,de_lat),cbind(lq_lon,lq_lat))

#calculate the closest hotel for each Denny's and the cloest Denny's for each hotel
MIN = function(x) c(which.min(x),min(x))
lq.min = apply(distance,2,MIN)
de.min = apply(distance,1,MIN)

#if the distance is smaller than 150 meters (= 0.0932057 mile), it should be thought of as "next to"
count = 0
dmin <- lq.min[2,]
for (i in 1:length(dmin)){
if(dmin[i] <0.0932057) count = count + 1
}
print(count)

```
